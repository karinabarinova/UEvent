# Table of Content
# UEvent

##description:

Our challenge was to create the service called uevent that helps organize/buy tickets to events

##**Database tables**:<br/>

- Users<br/>
- Events<br/>
- Companies<br/>
- Subscriptions<br/>
- Orders<br/>
- Formats<br/>
- Themes<br/>

#Future plans
- Functionality to choose whether the user wants to receive notifications about new visitors of their own event
- Invite friends to see event info
- Separate page for creating notifications â€“ choose a theme of the reminder and the reminder body
- Functionality to choose who can see the list of event visitors (everybody or only users who are going to the event)

#installation:
```md
> npm install
> mysql -u root
> CREATE USER kbarinova@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'swagswag69-69';
> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON * . * TO kbarinova@localhost;

```
#usage:
```md
> npm start
> cd front
> npm start
```
